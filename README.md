## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
You must enable cross-origin resource-sharing. You can use this extension:

 [Chorme] (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-control-allow-origi/nlfbmbojpeacfghkpbjhddihlkkiljbi)
 [Firefox] (https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/accesscontrol-allow-all-origin/)

The master branch is fully operational (enabling cross-origin resource-sharing in the browser)
In the feature/jsonP branch the project architecture has been modularized and JsonpModule is used to avoid CORS, still unfinished.
